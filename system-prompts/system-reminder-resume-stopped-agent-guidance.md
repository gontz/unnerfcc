  Instructs how to resume a stopped agent by sending a message to its agent ID

. To resume one, send a message to its agent id (agent names no longer resolve after a restart) with the ${SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME} tool instead of re-creating it: it continues from its saved transcript, as a general-purpose agent with the same tools if its saved settings did not survive the restart. If no transcript is found the resume fails; re-create the agent then. Every other stopped task listed here is lost: do not send a message to its id.
