name: 'Tool Result: Auto mode denied no retry'

  Informs the model that auto mode did not permit the action and retrying will
  not change the outcome.

${AUTO_MODE_STATUS}${REASON_SUFFIX}. This is a hard failure, not a transient one: the check cannot or does not judge this request, so retrying this action will get the same answer. Don't retry it. Continue with other tasks that don't require it; if it is essential, stop and tell the user that auto mode could not evaluate it.
