  Explains that macOS open and osascript are blocked by sandbox and instructs
  giving commands to user.
ccVersion: 2.1.292
-->
Opening an app, file or URL with `open`, or scripting another app with `osascript`, is blocked inside this sandbox (macOS Launch Services and Apple Events are off) and fails with errors such as -10822 (kLSServerCommunicationErr), -54, -600 or "LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed". That failure is the sandbox, not a problem with what you built; do not retry it with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`. Tell the user the sandbox blocked it and give them the exact command to run themselves.
