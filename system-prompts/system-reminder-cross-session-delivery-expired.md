[Cross-session delivery notice] ${MESSAGE_REF} ${RECIPIENT_REF} not approved before expiry${RECIPIENT_SESSION_DESC}. Not delivered to that session's Claude, and nothing is waiting there. Do not wait for a reply, and do not resend unprompted: while the two sessions' permission modes differ a resend is only held again. Tell your user what was not delivered and why; send ${MESSAGE_NAME} again, edited if that helps, when they ask.
