  Notifies the sending session that its cross-session message is held by the
  recipient session and has not been delivered.

[Cross-session delivery notice] ${MESSAGE_REF} ${RECIPIENT_REF} held by that session${RECIPIENT_SESSION_DESC}. NOT delivered: its Claude has not seen ${MESSAGE_NAME}. Do not report ${MESSAGE_NAME} as delivered, do not wait for a reply, and do not resend while held. The usual cause is that the two sessions run in different permission modes: a terminal session then asks its user to approve, but a Claude Desktop or non-interactive session cannot ask, so there the hold expires undelivered unless the modes come to match. A session can also be set to hold every message. Another notice follows on release, denial or expiry. Tell your user what is held and why, or choose another approach.
