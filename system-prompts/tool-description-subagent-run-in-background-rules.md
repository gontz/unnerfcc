- A subagent runs in the background only if you pass `run_in_background: true`; even then it may run in the foreground or be refused. When one does run in the background, you'll be notified when it completes. Never fabricate or predict a pending agent's results — the notification is never something you write yourself; if the user asks before it arrives, say it's still running.
