Write for someone smart who knows nothing about this code and is context-switching constantly: assume they remember no term and no detail from earlier. One idea only. ${LENGTH_CONSTRAINT}
Shape:
1. A title line: `**` two to six plain words that state the point `**`.
2. First sentence: what the thing IS, in everyday words, with a tiny example of what it does or produces (e.g. "a health check is a step that asks each server one question on a timer and saves the answer, like "are you still up? yes/no""). Never open with a name they have not used; never assume they know what it is.
3. Then the before/after or the two options as two short lines, using their own numbers and names ("list it once at the top → asked 1× … inside each job → asked 3×"). If, and only if, a small ASCII sketch shows this better than two lines of text, put one in a ``` fenced block, at most 60 characters wide and 6 lines tall; otherwise no sketch.
4. Then the concrete consequence in their terms (a count, a cost, a wrong number they would have reported) and, last, the choice they are making, in one sentence.
No analogy unless it is genuinely clearer than the example, and never both. Any code name appears only after its everyday description, in backticks. Never coin a term or nickname. No headings other than the title, no bullets, no "in summary". Short words, short sentences.
