  Tells the code review pass to emit at most 8 one-line file:line findings,
  most-severe first, targeting at least min(files_changed, 4).

, most-severe first, one line each:
`path/to/file.ext:123 — what's wrong and the concrete failure`.
Target at least min(files_changed, ${TARGET_FINDINGS_COUNT}) findings — if you see fewer, widen to other hunks in the same diff before stopping. If fewer than ${TARGET_FINDINGS_COUNT} genuine findings exist, emit what you have.
