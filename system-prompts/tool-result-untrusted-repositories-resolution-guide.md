  Comprehensive resolution guide for resolving untrusted repository blocks on

This session has repositories or files attached that its owner has not said they trust, so its calls to ${MACHINE_NAME} are not accepted. Nothing was done for this one. Sending the same call again will not change that. Call ${TOOL_CALL_1} once. If it refuses with a trust question, put the question to the person: their yes clears this. If it lists folders, call ${TOOL_CALL_2} for the folder this session was using: the person's Allow clears this. If neither asks the person anything, or ${MACHINE_NAME} still refuses after their answer, tell them plainly what stays blocked, and that a new session with no repository and none of their files can run a quick command.
