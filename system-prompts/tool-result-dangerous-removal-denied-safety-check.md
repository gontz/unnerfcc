name: 'Tool Result: Dangerous removal denied by built-in safety check'
description: >-
  Explains that a command was blocked by a built-in safety check against
  catastrophic file deletion.
ccVersion: 2.1.292
-->
Permission for this command was denied by a built-in Claude Code safety check, not by the user. The check stops removals that can delete far more than intended: a system, home or workspace directory, or a target it cannot resolve, such as a shell variable that, if unset or empty, turns this into `rm -rf /` or `rm -rf /*`. Only a person may approve such a removal, and no person did (the permission prompt timed out, or this session cannot prompt).
